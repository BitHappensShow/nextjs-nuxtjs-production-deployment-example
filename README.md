# SSR Application Deployment: NextJS vs NuxtJS

This repository provides production-ready configurations for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) applications built with **NextJS** and **NuxtJS**. It showcases best practices, deployment processes, and key differences between the two frameworks.

---

## **Overview**

- **NextJS**: React-based framework for SSR and SSG.
- **NuxtJS**: Vue-based framework with similar capabilities.

Both frameworks offer:
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO-friendly applications.
- Support for Dockerized environments.
- Scalable deployments using **PM2 Runtime**.

---

## **Key Differences**

### **Framework-Specific Configurations**

1. **NuxtJS Deployment**:
    - After running `npm run build`, the application is ready to copy to a server and run in Docker.
    - No additional configuration changes are required for production.

2. **NextJS Deployment**:
    - Requires modifying `next.config.js` to enable standalone output:
      ```javascript
      module.exports = {
        output: 'standalone',
      };
      ```
    - This makes the configuration similar to NuxtJS in Docker environments.

### **PM2 Runtime Configuration**

PM2 is used for managing Node.js processes efficiently. You can configure PM2 using two approaches:

- **`process.yml`**: Static, YAML-based configuration.
- **`ecosystem.config.js` or `ecosystem.config.ts`**: Dynamic configuration in JavaScript/TypeScript, preferred for flexibility.

## **Common Elements in Deployment**

### **Docker Setup**

- Base Image: `node:lts-alpine`
- Purpose: Provides a lightweight Node.js environment for SSR applications.

### **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

- SSR ensures the server generates HTML with content, making the application SEO-friendly.
- Node.js acts as a browser to generate all requests and sends pre-rendered HTML to the client.

### **PM2 Runtime**

PM2 balances traffic across multiple Node.js instances in cluster mode. Key benefits include:
- Improved scalability.
- Process management and monitoring.

#### **Useful PM2 Commands**
- `pm2 ls`: List all cluster elements.
- `pm2 logs`: View logs for debugging.
- `pm2 monit`: Monitor process details such as memory usage, uptime, and requests per minute.

## **Repository Contents**

- Example configurations for **NuxtJS** and **NextJS** deployments.
- Dockerfiles for running applications in containerized environments.
- PM2 configuration examples using both `process.yml` and `ecosystem.config.js`.

## **Conclusion**

Both NextJS and NuxtJS provide powerful tools for building SSR applications. While their configurations differ slightly, their deployment processes in Dockerized environments are highly comparable. This repository serves as a practical guide for deploying these frameworks effectively.
